# Homework Directory
## Welcome to my homework directory
### What is the point of this README file?
======================================
1. To provide a written overview of the contents of my homework directory
	* I may explain how I label files
	* I may explain what each assignment accomplishes
2. In addition to explaining what I have uploaded to my directory, README files can serve as important instructions for how to install or use programs that I write.
3. Some really nice READMEs also have embedded images and videos for palatability, especially if the owner of a repository intends to share it with the public or in a portfolio for a propspective employer.
